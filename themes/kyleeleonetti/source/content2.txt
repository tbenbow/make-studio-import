These are a few of my favorite things…a monthly-ish roundup what’s nourishing me at the moment.

To Read
The Ragamuffin Gospel: Good News for the Bedraggled, Beat-Up, and Burnt Out by Brennan Manning

Upon finishing this book I breathed out a huge sigh; it was just what my soul needed in these anxious times. The meditations at the end were the cherry on top, so make sure your copy includes 19 Mercies: A Spiritual Retreat! 

I got my copy on Thrift Books  and it came with a little scuff and kind of beat up, which seemed perfectly fitting to me due to the subject matter – but if you like shiny new things, here is the Amazon link.

Between Two Kingdoms By Suleika Jaouad

This was required reading for a recent writing class and I was entirely swept up in it, not only becoming enthralled by the author’s experiences, but by her ability to write about them with such clarity. This book is about major life interruptions, asking what happens when the life you want to return to no longer exists? An impressive, entertaining, and searching story that will stick with me. Buy it at Subtext books and they’ll ship it quick.

I’m Still Here by Austin Channing Brown

This is a spiritual memoir about “black dignity in a world made for whiteness”, a truth told in stories from the author’s life. I listened with solemn reverence for the opportunity to learn from such a strong woman of faith and powerful storyteller. Everyone should read this book.

Give it a listen on Audible, it’s read by the author (my fave!).

 

 

 

What If Jesus Was Serious? By Skye Jethani

These daily reflections left me more confident in understanding what it is Jesus wants from us. Spoiler alert: it’s more simple than we think!

Skye’s illustrations illuminate what Jesus said simply in his famous passage (The Sermon on the Mount) thousands of years ago, which we would be wise to learn from today.

I buy this book for so many people. Get a copy so we can talk about it!

To Try
BAR SOAP

We survived another brutal Minnesota winter with hardly any cracked or bleeding hands due to one big change: our family switched to bar soap! While it’s a bit messy, it’s made a huge difference. This is our favorite (made small batch in a kitchen in Toronto) when we can’t pick up our ACTUAL favorite, Mill City Soaps (sold at i like you, which is such a cute NE Minneapolis gift shop).

SOAR CBD

I used to have a discount code for you, but it expired – and yet somehow I’m still talking about SOAR CBD. Use it for stress or pain. Some people experience a reduction in anxiety. I frequently use their patches for sore muscles and cramps; each one contains 72 hours worth of CBD, time-released, which…is TMI about my showering frequency  

 

 

ONYX Candles

These hand-poured soy wax candles make anyone feel (and smell) like a rich lady! ONYX candles blend delightful scents (my favorite is Cabin Fever!) in several accessible sizes. They’re a women-owned small biz with a recycling program that lets you bring back empties for a refill at a reduced rate. Win for you, win for the environment, win for women in business – SHOP ONYX 

The GirlCreative Community

A place online (and off social media) for women to connect, create, and collaborate!

This is the online platform we made for GirlCreative, and I’m proud of what we’ve created to encourage and support women in these isolating times. Every 10th membership funds a scholarship for a woman who wants to join but can’t afford it – and we already have a list of scholarship applicants.  SIGN UP!

Truly Acai Your Boobies Boob Polish

Don’t forget to give your chest a thorough check for cancer every month (and your underarms, too — here’s a guide!). Boob Polish is a light and moisturizing product that smells so good, it creates a spa-like experience out of looking for lumps. Firm & tighten, claims the label; who knows, but it does help me remember my monthly self exams! Truly worth the money.

What the Minneapolis Teacher’s Strike Taught Me About Living in Uncertainty
Faith, Home Life, parenting, Uncategorized / Kylee Leonetti

It happened last month while I sat surrounded by baskets of unfolded laundry as a warm spring rain poured outside my windows. There was a book open beside me, but also the Netflix tab on my iPad, and a journal on my lap, plus half a dozen little unfinished projects littering my bedroom. It was […]

Pray for Discernment.
Faith, Home Life / Kylee Leonetti

True to my hibernation inclination, I read four books in January and hardly wrote a word. This month I’ve been back to work, and I will say it feels so good to be serving my clients with photos and film again after a long, dark, and quiet few weeks; it’s inspired me to look around

Write in erasable ink.
Uncategorized / Kylee Leonetti

It’s a new year, but I haven’t felt very ceremonious about it (anyone else?). I’m the same me…and honestly, I’ve been pretty sad. Several people in my immediate circle love people who are currently battling cancer. We’re somehow two years into a global pandemic with no sign of anything improving anytime soon. Spending one minute

Life is speaking.
Uncategorized / Kylee Leonetti

I’ve been trying to write for days and life has kept getting in the way, whether it’s been work or Christmas errands or this headache Christian and I keep passing back and forth. Thank God for free & convenient Covid-19 testing in Minnesota; the pandemic rages on, despite the lengthy denial speech I got from

Salve for the Living Thing
Uncategorized / Kylee Leonetti

I am running my finger on the edges of a wound That would heal if I only stopped picking but it gives me something to do with my hands; the busy countenance of an unsettled mind. I peel another strip of skin back, revealing More of the wound than I’d seen before It is wrinkled

Why I won’t watch Squid Game
Uncategorized / Kylee Leonetti

It’s come up a few times over dinner. The parodies and memes appear on all my social media feeds. Everyone says I need to see it.  But no, I won’t be watching Squid Game. The premise is enticing – regular people (fictional characters), competing on a television program (a la The Hunger Games), in a

Wednesday Wisdom: the way of grace outweighs perfection every single time
Uncategorized / Kylee Leonetti

If fall had an official mascot, in our house it would be, undisputedly, a buzzing drone honeybee: busy, with an all too short lifespan. Still it’s been full of sweetness: walks in a seasonal kaleidoscope of changing leaves, falling toward us like confetti. Lola turning fourteen, surrounded by her friends who piled into our minivan

Sunday Sentiment: the spookiest thing I can think of is this:
Uncategorized / Kylee Leonetti

It’s Halloween, but I promise you that’s not why we skipped church this morning. The sun was shining, Lola was at a sleepover, and we were still in bed hours after waking, not being lazy (as Christian pointed out) but reading together. We are going through the bible as a family, and talking about our

Sunday Sentiment: On rest
1 Comment / Uncategorized / Kylee Leonetti

September came and went like a whirlwind, full of energy, its chaotic swiftness leaving me wondering WTF happened as an entire month rushed by. I turned thirty five. Produced from start to completion two heartfelt documentaries with profound human stories for local nonprofits, and two silly commercials for a gala raising money for fostered dogs.

Bad Blood: On Conflict Resolution
Uncategorized / Kylee Leonetti

I grew up in a household that frequently experienced conflict. Oddly, there wasn’t much conflict with my parents directly, but between every other combination of family members, there was bad blood a lot of the time. My go-to response in conflict is to fight back — I once punched my mom in the face during
