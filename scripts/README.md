# Scripts

General-purpose utility scripts for the agent workspace.

## Active Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `check-media.ts` | Audit media files referenced by a site's blocks and pages |
| `inspect-page.ts` | Inspect a page's blocks, content, and field structure via the API |

## Archive

`scripts/archive/` contains one-off scripts from past site conversions (okgosandbox, peakperformance). These are kept for reference but are not part of the active workflow. Many use direct MongoDB access and should not be used for new work.
